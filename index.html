      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
A <a>controller document</a> is a set of data that specifies one or more
relationships between a <a>controller</a> and a set of data, such as a set of
public cryptographic keys. The <a>controller document</a> SHOULD
contain <a>verification relationships</a> that explicitly permit the use of
certain <a>verification methods</a> for specific purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
It is expected that other specifications using this specification
will profile the features that it defines,
requiring and/or recommending the use of some and
prohibiting and/or deprecating the use of others.

        <p>
A <dfn>conforming controller document</dfn> is any concrete expression of the
data model that follows the relevant normative requirements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#contexts-and-vocabularies"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn>conforming verification method</dfn> is any concrete expression of the
data model that follows the relevant normative requirements in Sections

        <h3>Terminology</h3>

        <p>
This section defines the terms used in this specification. A link to these terms
is included whenever they appear in this specification.

          <dd>
A process by which an entity can prove to a verifier that it has a specific

          <dd>
A specification defining the usage of specific cryptographic primitives in
order to achieve a particular security goal. These documents are often used
to specify [=verification methods=], digital signature types,
their identifiers, and other related properties.<!--  See Section -->
<!-- [[[#cryptographic-suites]]] for further detail. -->
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn class="export" data-lt="controller(s)">controller</dfn></dt>

An entity that has the capability to make changes to a
[=controller document=].
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn class="export" data-lt="controller documents">controller document</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A set of data that specifies one or more relationships between a
[=controller=] and a set of data, such as a set of public cryptographic keys.
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects">subject</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The entity identified by the `id` property in a [=controller document=].
Anything can be a subject: person, group, organization, physical thing, digital
thing, logical thing, etc.
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn class="export">verification method</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independently
verify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as a
verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
verifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.
            </p>
            <p>
"Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
example, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key
exchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the
integrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification
method, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words
"verification" or "proof."

          <dt><dfn class="export">verification relationship</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
An expression of the relationship between the [=subject=] and a

        <h3>Data Model</h3>

        <p>
A <a>controller document</a> is a set of data that specifies one or more
relationships between a <a>controller</a> and a set of data, such as a set of
public cryptographic keys. The <a>controller document</a> SHOULD
contain <a>verification relationships</a> that explicitly permit the use of
certain <a>verification methods</a> for specific purposes.

controller documents published on a ledger-based registry, or on a mutable medium in
combination with an integrity protection mechanism such as Hashlinks.

        <section>
          <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
          <p>
A <a>controller document</a> can express <a>verification methods</a>, such as
cryptographic <a>public keys</a>, which can be used to <a>authenticate</a> or
authorize interactions with the <a>controller</a> or associated parties. For
example, a cryptographic <a>public key</a> can be used as a <a>verification
method</a> with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it verifies that
the signer could use the associated cryptographic private key. <a>Verification
methods</a> might take many parameters. An example of this is a set of five
cryptographic keys from which any three are required to contribute to a
cryptographic threshold signature.

The semantics of the `controller` property are the same when the
subject of the relationship is the <a>controller document</a> as when the subject of
the relationship is a <a>verification method</a>, such as a cryptographic public
key. Since a key can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be inferred
from the <a>controller document</a>, it is necessary to explicitly express the identity
of the controller of the key. The difference is that the value of
`controller` for a <a>verification method</a> is <em>not</em>
necessarily a <a>controller</a>. <a>controllers</a> are expressed
using the `<a>controller</a>` property at the highest level of the
<a>controller document</a>.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h3>Verification Material</h3>

            <p>
Verification material is any information that is used by a process that applies
a <a>verification method</a>. The `type` of a <a>verification method</a> is
expected to be used to determine its compatibility with such processes. Examples
of verification methods include `JsonWebKey` and `Multikey`.
A <a>cryptographic suite</a> specification is responsible for specifying the
<a>verification method</a> `type` and its associated verification material
format. For examples, see
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/">Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE</a>,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa/">the Data Integrity ECDSA
Cryptosuites</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ed25519-2020/">
the Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites</a>.
<!-- VC-DATA-INTEGRITY-SPECIFIC:
For a list of <a>verification
method</a> types, please see the [[?SECURITY-VOCABULARY]].
-->
            </p>

            <p>
To increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations, this specification
limits the number of formats for expressing verification material in a
<a>controller document</a>. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between easing implementation
and providing support for formats that have historically had broad deployment.
            </p>

            <p>
A <a>verification method</a> MUST NOT contain multiple verification material
properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a
<a>verification method</a> using both `publicKeyJwk` and
`publicKeyMultibase` at the same time is prohibited.
            </p>

            <p>
Implementations MAY convert keys between formats as desired for operational purposes or
to interface with cryptographic libraries. As an internal implementation detail, such
conversion MUST NOT affect the external representation of key material.
            </p>

            <p>
An example of a <a>controller document</a> containing <a>verification
methods</a> using both properties above is shown below.

            <h3>Multikey</h3>
            <p>
The Multikey data model is a specific type of <a>verification method</a> that
encodes key types into a single binary stream that is then encoded as a
Multibase value as described in Section <a href="#multibase-0"></a>.
            </p>

            <p>
When specifing a `Multikey`, the object takes the following form:
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>type</dt>
              <dd>
The value of the `type` property MUST contain the string `Multikey`.
              </dd>
              <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">publicKeyMultibase</dfn></dt>
              <dd>
The `publicKeyMultibase` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST be a
Multibase encoded value as described in Section <a href="#multibase-0"></a>.
              </dd>
              <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">secretKeyMultibase</dfn></dt>
              <dd>
The `secretKeyMultibase` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST be a
Multibase encoded value as described in Section <a href="#multibase-0"></a>.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of a Multikey is provided below:
            </p>

  "publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkmM42vxfqZQsv4ehtTjFFxQ4sQKS2w6WR7emozFAn5cxu"
}
            </pre>

            <p>
In the example above, the `publicKeyMultibase` value starts with the letter `z`,
which is the <a href="#multibase-0">Multibase</a> header that conveys that the
binary data is base-58-btc-encoded using the Bitcoin base-encoding alphabet. The
decoded binary data header is `0xed01`, which specifies that the
remaining data is a 32-byte raw Ed25519 <a>public key</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
The Multikey data model is also capable of encoding secret keys, whose subtypes
include <em>symmetric keys</em> and <em>private keys</em>.
            </p>

          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>JsonWebKey</h3>
            <p>
The JSON Web Key (JWK) data model is a specific type of <a>verification method</a>
that uses the JWK specification [[RFC7517]] to encode key types into a
set of parameters.
            </p>

            <p>
When specifing a `JsonWebKey`, the object takes the following form:
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>type</dt>
              <dd>
The value of the `type` property MUST contain the string `JsonWebKey`.
              </dd>
              <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">publicKeyJwk</dfn></dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
The `publicKeyJwk` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> representing a JSON Web Key that
conforms to [[RFC7517]]. The <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST NOT
include any members of the private information class, such as `d`, as described
in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-8.1.1">JWK
Registration Template</a>. It is RECOMMENDED that verification methods that use
JWKs [[RFC7517]] to represent their <a>public keys</a> use the value of `kid` as
their fragment identifier. It is RECOMMENDED that JWK `kid` values are set to
the public key fingerprint [[RFC7638]]. See the first key in
<a href="#example-various-verification-method-types"></a> for an example of a
public key with a compound key identifier.
                </p>
                <p>
As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7517#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of the JWK specification</a>,
the OPTIONAL `alg` property identifies the algorithm intended for use with the public key,
and SHOULD be included to prevent security issues that can arise when using the same
key with multiple algorithms. As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7518#section-6.2.1.1">
Section 6.2.1.1 of the JWA specification</a>, describing a key using an elliptic curve,
the REQUIRED `crv` property is used to identify the particular curve type of the public key.
As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7515#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4 of the JWS specification</a>,
the OPTIONAL `kid` property is a hint used to help discover the key; if present, the `kid` value SHOULD
match, or be included in, the `id` property of the encapsulating `JsonWebKey` object,
as part of the path, query, or fragment of the URL.
                </p>

              </dd>
              <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">secretKeyJwk</dfn></dt>
              <dd>
The `secretKeyJwk` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> representing a JSON Web Key that conforms
to [[RFC7517]].
It MUST NOT be used if the data structure containing it is public or may be revealed to parties other than the legitimate holders of the secret key.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of an object that conforms to `JsonWebKey` is provided below:
            </p>

            <pre class="example nohighlight" title="JSON Web Key encoding of a secp384r1 (P-384) public key">
{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
  "type": "JsonWebKey",
  "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "publicKeyJwk": {
      "kid": "key-1",
      "kty": "EC",
      "crv": "P-384",
      "alg": "ES384",
      "x": "1F14JSzKbwxO-Heqew5HzEt-0NZXAjCu8w-RiuV8_9tMiXrSZdjsWqi4y86OFb5d",
      "y": "dnd8yoq-NOJcBuEYgdVVMmSxonXg-DU90d7C4uPWb_Lkd4WIQQEH0DyeC2KUDMIU"
    }
}
            </pre>

            <p>
In the example above, the `publicKeyJwk` value contains the JSON Web Key.
The `kty` property encodes the key type of "OKP", which means
"Octet string key pairs". The `alg` property identifies the algorithm intended
for use with the public key, which in this case is `ES384`. The `crv` property identifies
the particular curve type of the public key, `P-384`. The `x` property specifies
the point on the P-384 curve that is associated with the public key.
            </p>

            <p>
The `publicKeyJwk` property MUST NOT contain any property marked as
"Private" or "Secret" in any registry contained in the JOSE Registries [[JOSE-REGISTRIES]], including "d".
            </p>

            <p>
The JSON Web Key data model is also capable of encoding <em>secret keys</em>, sometimes
referred to as <em>private keys</em>.
            </p>

            <pre class="example nohighlight"
              title="JSON Web Key encoding of a secp384r1 (P-384) secret key">
{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
  "type": "JsonWebKey",
  "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "secretKeyJwk": {
      "kty": "EC",
      "crv": "P-384",
      "alg": "ES384",
      "d": "fGwges0SX1mj4eZamUCL4qtZijy9uT15fI4gKTuRvre4Kkoju2SHM4rlFOeKVraH",

    }
}
            </pre>

            <p>
The private key example above is almost identical to the previous example of the
public key, except that the information is stored in the `secretKeyJwk` property
(rather than the `publicKeyJwk`), and the private key value is encoded in the `d`
property thereof (alongside the `x` property, which still specifies the point on
the Ed25519 curve that is associated with the public key).

            <h3>Referring to Verification Methods</h3>
            <p>
<a>Verification methods</a> can be embedded in or referenced from properties
associated with various <a>verification relationships</a> as described in <a

allows them to be used by more than one <a>verification relationship</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
If the value of a <a>verification method</a> property is a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>, the <a>verification method</a> has been
embedded and its properties can be accessed directly. However, if the value is a
URL <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, the <a>verification method</a> has
been included by reference and its properties will need to be retrieved from
elsewhere in the <a>controller document</a> or from another <a>controller document</a>. This
is done by dereferencing the URL and searching the resulting resource for a
<a>verification method</a> <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> with an
`id` property whose value matches the URL.

          <h2>Verification Relationships</h2>

          <p>
A <a>verification relationship</a> expresses the relationship between the
<a>controller</a> and a <a>verification method</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
Different <a>verification relationships</a> enable the associated
<a>verification methods</a> to be used for different purposes. It is up to a
<em>verifier</em> to ascertain the validity of a verification attempt by
checking that the <a>verification method</a> used is contained in the
appropriate <a>verification relationship</a> property of the
<a>controller document</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
The <a>verification relationship</a> between the <a>controller</a> and the
<a>verification method</a> is explicit in the <a>controller document</a>.
<a>Verification methods</a> that are not associated with a particular
<a>verification relationship</a> cannot be used for that <a>verification
relationship</a>. For example, a <a>verification method</a> in the value of
the `<a>authentication</a>` property cannot be used to engage in
key agreement protocols with the <a>controller</a>&mdash;the value of the
`<a>keyAgreement</a>` property needs to be used for that.
          </p>
          <p>

If authentication is established, it is up to the application to decide what to
do with that information.
            </p>
            <p>
This is useful to any <em>authentication verifier</em> that needs to check to
see if an entity that is attempting to <a>authenticate</a> is, in fact,
presenting a valid proof of authentication. When a <em>verifier</em> receives
some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made
for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified
by the `id`, then that <em>verifier</em> checks to ensure that the proof can be
verified using a <a>verification method</a> (e.g., <a>public key</a>) listed
under `<a>authentication</a>` in the <a>controller document</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
Note that the <a>verification method</a> indicated by the
`<a>authentication</a>` property of a <a>controller document</a> can
only be used to <a>authenticate</a> the <a>controller</a>. To
<a>authenticate</a> a different <a>controller</a>, the entity associated with
the value of `controller` needs to <a>authenticate</a> with its
<em>own</em> <a>controller document</a> and associated
`<a>authentication</a>` <a>verification relationship</a>.

            <h2>Key Agreement</h2>

            <p>
The `keyAgreement` <a>verification relationship</a> is used to
specify how an entity can generate encryption material in order to transmit
confidential information intended for the <a>controller</a>, such as for
the purposes of establishing a secure communication channel with the recipient.

            <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when encrypting a message intended

            <h2>Capability Invocation</h2>

            <p>
The `capabilityInvocation` <a>verification relationship</a> is used
to specify a <a>verification method</a> that might be used by the
<a>controller</a> to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the
authorization to update the <a>controller document</a>.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt id="defn-capabilityInvocation">capabilityInvocation</dt>

The `capabilityInvocation` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more <a>verification methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be
embedded or referenced.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a <a>controller</a> needs to
access a protected HTTP API that requires authorization in order to use it. In
order to authorize when using the HTTP API, the <a>controller</a>
uses a capability that is associated with a particular URL that is
exposed via the HTTP API. The invocation of the capability could be
expressed in a number of ways, e.g., as a digitally signed
message that is placed into the HTTP Headers.
            </p>
            <p>
The server providing the HTTP API is the <em>verifier</em> of the capability and
it would need to verify that the <a>verification method</a> referred to by the
invoked capability exists in the `capabilityInvocation`
property of the <a>controller document</a>. The verifier would also check to make sure
that the action being performed is valid and the capability is appropriate for
the resource being accessed. If the verification is successful, the server has
cryptographically determined that the invoker is authorized to access the
protected resource.
            </p>

            <h2>Capability Delegation</h2>

            <p>
The `capabilityDelegation` <a>verification relationship</a> is used
to specify a mechanism that might be used by the <a>controller</a> to delegate
a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the authority
to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.

            <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a <a>controller</a> chooses
to delegate their capability to access a protected HTTP API to a party other
than themselves. In order to delegate the capability, the <a>controller</a>
would use a <a>verification method</a> associated with the
`capabilityDelegation` <a>verification relationship</a> to
cryptographically sign the capability over to another <a>controller</a>. The
delegate would then use the capability in a manner that is similar to the
example described in <a href="#capability-invocation"></a>.

alignment between the Multibase values used in this specification and the
Multibase values defined by the current Multibase community and any potential

        <p>
A Multibase string includes a single character header which identifies the
base and encoding alphabet used to encode a binary value, followed by the
encoded binary value (using that base and alphabet). The common Multibase

with the desired base encoding and alphabet from the table above, ensuring to
prepend the associated Multibase header from the table above to the result.
Any algorithm with equivalent output MAY be used.

          <h3>Context Injection</h3>

          <p>
The `@context` property is used to ensure that implementations are using the
same semantics when terms in this specification are processed. For example, this
can be important when properties like `type` are processed and its value, such
as `DataIntegrityProof`, are used.
          </p>

          <p>
If an `@context` property is not provided in a document that is being secured or
verified, or the Data Integrity terms used in the document are not mapped by
existing values in the `@context` property, implementations MUST inject or add
an `@context` property with a value of
`https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v2`.
          </p>

          <p>
Context injection is expected to be unnecessary sometimes, such as when the Verifiable
Credential Data Model v2.0 context (`https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2`)
exists as a value in the `@context` property, as that context maps all of the
necessary Data Integrity terms that were previously mapped by
`https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v2`.

          <p>
<a href="#multibase">Multibase</a>-encoded strings are used to encode binary
data into ASCII-only formats, which are useful in environments that cannot
directly represent binary values. This specification makes use of this encoding.
In environments that support data types for string values, such as RDF
[[?RDF-CONCEPTS]], <a href="#multibase">Multibase</a>-encoded content is
indicated using a literal value whose datatype is set to
`https://w3id.org/security#multibase`.
          </p>

          <p>
The `multibase` datatype is defined as follows:
          </p>

            </dd>
            <dt>The lexical space</dt>
            <dd>
Any string that starts with a <a href="#multibase">Multibase</a> character and
the rest of the characters consist of allowable characters in the respective
base-encoding alphabet.

            </dd>
            <dt>The lexical-to-value mapping</dt>
            <dd>
Any element of the lexical space is mapped to the value space by base-decoding
the value based on the base-decoding alphabet associated with the
first <a href="#multibase">Multibase</a> character in the lexical string.

        <h3>Processing Errors</h3>

        <p>
The algorithms described in this specification throw specific types of errors.
Implementers might find it useful to convey these errors to other libraries or
software systems. This section provides specific URLs, descriptions, and error
codes for the errors, such that an ecosystem implementing technologies described
by this specification might interoperate more effectively when errors occur.
        </p>

        <p>
When exposing these errors through an HTTP interface, implementers SHOULD use
[[RFC9457]] to encode the error data structure. If [[RFC9457]] is used:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The `type` value of the error object MUST be a URL that starts with the value
`https://w3id.org/security#` and ends with the value in the section listed
below.
          </li>
          <li>
The `code` value MUST be the integer code described in the table below
(in parentheses, beside the type name).
          </li>
          <li>
The `title` value SHOULD provide a short but specific human-readable string for
the error.
          </li>
          <li>
The `detail` value SHOULD provide a longer human-readable string for the error.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <dt id="INVALID_VERIFICATION_METHOD_URL">INVALID_VERIFICATION_METHOD_URL (-21)</dt>

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes accessibility considerations that developers
implementing this specification are urged to consider in order to ensure that
their software is usable by people with different cognitive, motor, and visual
needs. As a general rule, this specification is used by system software and does
not directly expose individuals to information subject to accessibility
considerations. However, there are instances where individuals might be
indirectly exposed to information expressed by this specification and thus the
guidance below is provided for those situations.

      <p class="issue">Write Accessibility Considerations section</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Presenting Time Values</h2>
        <p>
This specification enables the expression of dates and times related to the
validity period of cryptographic proofs. This information might be indirectly
exposed to an individual if a proof is processed and is detected to be outside
an allowable time range. When exposing these dates and times to an individual,
implementers are urged to take into account
<a data-cite="?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0#representing-time">cultural normas and locales
when representing dates and times</a> in display software. In addition to these
considerations, presenting time values in a way that eases the cognitive burden
on the individual receiving the information is a suggested best practice.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, when conveying the expiration date for a particular set of
digitally signed information, implementers are urged to present the time of
expiration using language that is easier to understand rather than language that
optimizes for accuracy. Presenting the expiration time as "This ticket expired
three days ago." is preferred over a phrase such as "This ticket expired on July
25th 2023 at 3:43 PM." The former provides a relative time that is easier to
comprehend than the latter time, which requires the individual to do the
calculation in their head and presumes that they are capable of doing such a
calculation.
